# GoogD0rker

## About
GoogD0rker is a tool for firing off google dorks against a target domain, it is purely for OSINT against a specific target domain. Designed for OSX, if you want to tweak it for Linux simply use sed: `sed 's/open/newbrowser/g' googd0rker > googd0rker-newbrowser`. It is modified from goohak by [crowdshield](https://github.com/1N3/Goohak).
